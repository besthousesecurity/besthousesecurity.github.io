<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the wise alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anybody in your home and those close-by that there's an issue. Throughout testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to represent pets, too. The alarm is simply one of two we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're pleased that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from attempting to break in to your property. We tested Somfy's more pricey system, which included a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly sets are also offered. Despite the hefty cost here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
<p>Vivint's equipment is the most highly advanced of all the security companies on our list.
