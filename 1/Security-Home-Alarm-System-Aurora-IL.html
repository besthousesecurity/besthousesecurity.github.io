<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the precise same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current.

Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
