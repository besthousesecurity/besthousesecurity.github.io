<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
