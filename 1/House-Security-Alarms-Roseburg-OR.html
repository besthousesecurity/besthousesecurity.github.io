<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not link.
