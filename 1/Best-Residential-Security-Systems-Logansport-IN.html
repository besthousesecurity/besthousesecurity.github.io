By searching for the license plate varieties of cars parked at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were married.

<p>The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are clearly not deterred by camera - and may even be drawn in to the television protection cameras can guarantee - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system might provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
