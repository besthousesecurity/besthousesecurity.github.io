<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
