The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
