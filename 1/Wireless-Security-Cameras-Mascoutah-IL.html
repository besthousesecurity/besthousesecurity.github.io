I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
