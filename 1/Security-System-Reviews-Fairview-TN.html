<p>Everything about Security offers expert, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the greater Indianapolis area. We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
