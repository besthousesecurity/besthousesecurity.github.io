<h4>Security Monitoring Systems For Home Mahopac 10541</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional complaints, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
