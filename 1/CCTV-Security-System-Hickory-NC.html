The loudest of the clever alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anybody in your home and those neighboring that there's an issue.

The alarm is just one of 2 we checked that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it likewise features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anybody from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property. We tested Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly packages are also offered.

What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually noticed some enhancements because the camera's launch, and will continue to test and update this evaluation, as needed.</p>
<p>Night vision: All outdoor Wi-Fi cameras should have night-vision ability. The night-vision range can be a factor, depending on where you plan to position the camera.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little an issue is between discovering and tape-recording movement. It takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it spots motion since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording. If a nefarious bad guy was fast enough, they might surpass the camera before it had time to tape-record them.</p>
