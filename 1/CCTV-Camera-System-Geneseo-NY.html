I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
