<p>Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensing units to accomplish the advantages of both.

<p>No pressure choice: An expertly monitored system frequently includes a duress PIN. The house owner can turn off the alarm using the pressure PIN if an intruder forces a homeowner to deactivate the system.

<p>Frontpoint offers five packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy however wound up dissatisfied with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on trip, she had no chance of determining whether her home had actually been burglarized or if her cat had managed to journey the sensor. It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
