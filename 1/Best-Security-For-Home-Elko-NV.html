<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<h4>Home Alarm Security System Elko 89801</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional problems, 2 weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
