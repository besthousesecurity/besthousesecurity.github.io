We value that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
