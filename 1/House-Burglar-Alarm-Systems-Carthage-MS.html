<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
