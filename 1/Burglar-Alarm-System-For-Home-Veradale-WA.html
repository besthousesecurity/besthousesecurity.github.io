<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive plan but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm alert while on getaway, she had no chance of evaluating whether her home had been broken into or if her cat had handled to journey the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
