<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
