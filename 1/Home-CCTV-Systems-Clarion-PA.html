<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
