<p>All About Security supplies professional, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the higher Indianapolis location. We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
