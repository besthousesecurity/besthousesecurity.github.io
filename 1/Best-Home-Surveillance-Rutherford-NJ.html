<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone device or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When someone rings the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera. That video can go to your smartphone, computer system, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras are part of many home automated systems and provide an extra layer of protection. These cameras often feature two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensor. As with any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of vision. When wireless doorbell cameras trigger, the person outside your home will have no idea whether you are on the opposite of the door or on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider: DIY installation indicates that moving your system is super easy. So if you think your business is most likely to change places, that's something to bear in mind.

We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, however the white and black variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a huge offer thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick to white and black.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen often enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
