It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

Nevertheless, the absence of a camera is a significant oversight and they need to update their clever home integration systems.</p>
