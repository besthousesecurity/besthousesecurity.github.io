Home has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better range for sensors. Both the initial House system and the Abode Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that also works with HomeKit.
