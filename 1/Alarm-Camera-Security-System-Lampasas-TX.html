<p>Almost all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their main communication source. Most web connected security systems include a battery backup, which means if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a limited quantity of time. However, if your internet goes down, sadly, you will be without an alarm system up until it returns up.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
