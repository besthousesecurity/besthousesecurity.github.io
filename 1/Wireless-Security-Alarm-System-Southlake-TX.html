<h4>Security Camera Outdoor Southlake 76092</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently undergone thorough background checks.
