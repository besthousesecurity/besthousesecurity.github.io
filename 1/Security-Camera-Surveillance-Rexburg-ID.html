<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
