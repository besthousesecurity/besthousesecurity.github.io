<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional problems, two weeks later on a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
