<h4>House Burglar Alarm Pleasant Valley 12569</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently undergone extensive background checks.

Following further complaints, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant service charges to complete the installation.</p>
