No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
