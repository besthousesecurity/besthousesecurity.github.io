<p>You use a keypad to by hand arm and deactivate your home security system. Like many wireless security equipment, keypads can be installed anywhere you want. Many wireless keypads are placed by the front door, but it doesn't need to be.

The keypad enables you to enter your security code in case the alarm is triggered while you are at home. Choose an available placement that works for you.</p>
