<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
