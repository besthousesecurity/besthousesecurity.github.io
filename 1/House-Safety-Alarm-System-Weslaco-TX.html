<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
