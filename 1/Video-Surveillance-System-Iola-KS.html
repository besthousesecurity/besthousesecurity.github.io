<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
