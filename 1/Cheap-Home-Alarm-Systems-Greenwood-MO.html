<p>Failing to Secure Doors and Windows Properly - Not completely closing windows and doors before setting the alarm can prompt the system to go off. Also, loose or defective contacts on your windows or doors can set off incorrect alarms. In order to secure your network, we strongly recommend you to disable the wireless home network, in case of prolonged durations of non-use.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
