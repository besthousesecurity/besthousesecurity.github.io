<p>Everything about Security provides professional, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis location. The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>You get peace of mind knowing that home and whatever in it is secured when you select one of the best home security systems on the market.

<p>Another important subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices.

The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
