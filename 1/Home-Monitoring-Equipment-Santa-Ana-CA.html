<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
