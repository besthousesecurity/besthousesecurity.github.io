<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is super affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
