<p>The first (and most apparent, for sure) part of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are right for your system depends on your specific needs and budget plan; are you putting them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a big sufficient resolution? Will they have the ability to record and see video effectively in low-lighting? Are they placed with appropriate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be needed?
