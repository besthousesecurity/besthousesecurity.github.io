<p>Here are the information: it catches 1080p HD footage, in the day or in the dark thanks to night vision, and all at a quality level that matches a great deal of rivals. The field of view limitation is 110 degrees, less than the very best rivals out there, however that in fact indicates sharper footage (with each pixel covering less of the view).
