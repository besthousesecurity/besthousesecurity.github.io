Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.

We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
