<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
