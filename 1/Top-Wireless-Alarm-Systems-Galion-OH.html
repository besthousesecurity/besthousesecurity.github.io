Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake.

The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks.
