Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks.
