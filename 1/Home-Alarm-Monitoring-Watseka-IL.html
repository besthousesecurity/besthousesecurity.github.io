<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake.

The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more problems, two weeks later a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
