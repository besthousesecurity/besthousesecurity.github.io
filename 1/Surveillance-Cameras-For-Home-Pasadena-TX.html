<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either inside your home or outside, and includes a practical mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the rate, and best of all, it features free cloud storage (up to two hours in total). Since Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app also has a connection to Ring's Next-door neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other occurrences in your neighborhood, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is fairly robust, and while it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has plenty of features for the price.</p>

<p>Home security systems are readily available in 2 basic kinds: monitored and unmonitored.
