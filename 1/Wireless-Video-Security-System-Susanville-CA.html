<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
