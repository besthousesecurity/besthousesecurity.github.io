<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they may be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

<p>Monitored alarms and speaker phones enable the main station to speak to the house owner or intruder. This might be helpful to the owner for medical emergency situations.

<p>Sensing units are detectors built into the alarm that transmit signals to the control panel. Common home security sensors consist of those created for walls, garages, doors, and windows. Some window sensing units now include glass break detection. Lots of security systems have crash-and-smash sensors, which sound an alarm when somebody (such as an intruder) tries to tamper with or damage the control board.</p>
