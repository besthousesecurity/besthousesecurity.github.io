The camera is simple to place, and can be wall mounted. There's no option for battery power, and it's not developed to be out in the elements either. Overall, while the Neos SmartCam isn't as technically advanced as other cameras, for the price it's an amazingly bargain.

<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Grove City</h3>
