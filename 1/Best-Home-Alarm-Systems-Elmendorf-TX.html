<h3>Attempting to Outsmart a Home Security System in Elmendorf</h3>
<p>With a PTZ (Pan Tilt & Zoom) camera, your security group can have total control on what is recorded. At the touch of a button, the camera lens can pan left and right, tilt up and down or zoom in and out.

And the PTZ function makes this CCTV camera type suitable for outdoors for a complete protection of the backyard, the front door, the garden, the garage, the driveway, etc. You are also totally free to position it at high positions, like the 3rd floor patio area, since you can constantly zoom in for information.</p>
