I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall.

Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
