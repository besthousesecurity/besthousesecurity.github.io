DVRs, or digital video recorders, are the modern-day replacement for analog recorders that utilize videotapes. DVRs record footage from analog cameras in a digital format at the desired resolution and frames per second.

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

It provides an outstanding image, clear two-way audio, practical smart-home integration, 7 days of complimentary cloud storage, and the choice to include a USB drive for local video storage. For a cost, you can include person, animal, and car detection and more cloud-based video storage.</p>
