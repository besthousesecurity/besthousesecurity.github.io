<p>Burglar alarms have become basic equipment in shops and other companies, and they're becoming significantly typical in personal homes also. Motion detectors are typically stationed at entry walls and in big rooms, and they are simple to set up. When they find movement, the alarm is set off and other security devices (such as a camera) might be activated.
