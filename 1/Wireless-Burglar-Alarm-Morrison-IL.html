Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
