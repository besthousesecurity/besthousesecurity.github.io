I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
