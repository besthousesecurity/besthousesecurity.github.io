This camera offers a variety of features including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.

This more recent version is much the same, to be frank.</p>

Without having the ability to see a visual verification, you will either need to hurry back home only to find a false alarm or you'll have to contact your next-door neighbors, good friends, or family to check in.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
