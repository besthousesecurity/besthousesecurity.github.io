<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off).

<p>As the name recommends, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's basically anticipated that it will not have actually extended customizability or a vast array of features. However, I am still dissatisfied that they haven't consisted of at least a basic camera with this package.
