<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
