<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it discovers an intruder; a convenient intercom function that allows the gadget to serve as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
<p>Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you pick will need to reflect the landscape in order to supply a clear, beneficial image.

SimpliSafe also deals with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, enabling you to equip and check the system utilizing just voice commands.

Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
