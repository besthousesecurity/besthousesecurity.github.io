<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
