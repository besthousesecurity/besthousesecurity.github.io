<h4>Residential Alarm Monitoring New Philadelphia 44663</h4>
<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively steep price: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with 30 days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and features storage as much as 31 days.</p>
