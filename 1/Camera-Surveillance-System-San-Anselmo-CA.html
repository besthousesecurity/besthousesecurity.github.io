Another perk of using IP CCTV cameras is that the resolution that can be achieved far surpasses the video quality that can be delivered while using analog technology.">

<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
