<h3>Wireless Security Camera Systems in Wellington FL 33414</h3>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
