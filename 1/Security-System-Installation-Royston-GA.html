Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further problems, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
