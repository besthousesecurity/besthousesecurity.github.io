However I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

These gadgets are weatherproof and generally require a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to supply power, although there are a handful of battery-powered models out there. Just like their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone. They are relatively simple to install, but if you're comfy or not familiar with electrical circuitry, you may wish to have a professional electrician do the job.</p>
