<p>We had regularly pleasant, useful interactions with Frontpoint's customer care, and were particularly delighted about its simple DIY install After a grand total of half an hour, we were able to get our control board linked and online, place our door sensors, and activate the system. Our tester did hit a roadblock when his control board would not link, but a service representative attended to the concern right away and new equipment showed up the next day.</p>
<p>ADT is a household name, so we frequently experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of testing, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with clever smart home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
