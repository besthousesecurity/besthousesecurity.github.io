<p>ADT is a household name, so we frequently experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task.

We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with clever smart home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
