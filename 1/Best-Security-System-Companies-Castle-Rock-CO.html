<h4>CCTV Security System Castle Rock 80104</h4>
<p>Figure 1-1 illustrates an example of a CCTV installation that monitors select areas of coverage. The very first installation was created and established for the separate parking facility. This application consisted of several fixed position cameras on each floor of the parking garage, stairwells, and exits, all connected straight to a primary control unit (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a simple device for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions.

<p>Motion sensing units offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they just operate when you run out the house.

It would incorrect alarm every time you walked into a secured room if the system worked any other method.</p>
