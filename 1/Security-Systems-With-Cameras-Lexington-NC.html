<p>When I speak about my deal with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I generally get the Huge Bro is viewing" comment, referring to George Orwell's universal socialistic watcher called Big Sibling in his book 1984. This Orwellian" worry is that somebody somewhere might be watching you through a video surveillance camera this very minute and that somebody somewhere is abusing the system to break your flexibility and personal privacy. Fortunately, you're not doing anything prohibited, simply reading this book, and hopefully not behind the wheel of a getaway vehicle, idling in front of a neighborhood bank or terrorist target, or speeding through a red light at a high-risk intersection.</p>
<p>For optimal around-the-clock protection, you can select to have your alarm monitored by a Central Monitoring Station.
