<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.

I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because obviously they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
