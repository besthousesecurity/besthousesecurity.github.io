<h2>Home Security And Alarm Systems in Florence Kentucky</h2>
<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is required for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is among the downsides of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be challenging and costly to install, especially for larger camera networks, and those were cameras must be placed in hard locations.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of usage, day and night images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and cars.</p>
<p>This CCTV camera type is rather misleading to be called "wireless". The key to any system providing the most benefit to its owner is to maximize system up time. We have actually selected the people and products that ensure this outcome.
