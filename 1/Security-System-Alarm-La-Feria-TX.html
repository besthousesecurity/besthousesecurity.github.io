<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
