These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their inventory. Look at the ceiling of consumer electronics stores and storage facility chains and you will observe in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason why.</p>

Whether you require security versus intrusion, fire, medical emergencies or perhaps a home invasion, a Valley Alarm home security specialist will design a fully incorporated system that gives you and your household the protection and peace-of-mind you should have.</p>
<p>The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit more affordable than the wireless systems. While this might appear appealing in the beginning, think of all of the drawbacks to the wired systems that we have actually currently mentioned. Answering the concern Who's at my door this time?" has never ever been simpler. Whether you're home or away, you can check your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>
