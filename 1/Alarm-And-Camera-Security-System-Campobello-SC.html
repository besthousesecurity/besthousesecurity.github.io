<h4>Security Surveillance Cameras Campobello 29322</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently undergone thorough background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
