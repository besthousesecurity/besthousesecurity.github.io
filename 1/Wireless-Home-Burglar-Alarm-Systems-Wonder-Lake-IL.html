<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was discovered. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
