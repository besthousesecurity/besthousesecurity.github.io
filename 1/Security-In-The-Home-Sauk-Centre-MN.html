It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

<h3>Factors to Consider When Buying a Home Security Camera in Sauk Centre</h3>
<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually noticed some enhancements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to update this evaluation and test, as required.</p>
