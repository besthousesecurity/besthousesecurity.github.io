<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. The Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends out alerts straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide variety of features consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway.
