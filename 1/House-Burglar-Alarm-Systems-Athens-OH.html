<p>Do alarm systems represent burglary declines in the United States? The U.S. break-in rate has actually decreased gradually and considerably because the early 1980s. 13 During the very same time, the number of premises with alarms rose, however there is no evidence of a link between the two. Throughout the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other kinds of criminal activity decreased just as dramatically as break-in, suggesting that elements besides a boost in the number of alarm systems fueled the burglary decline.</p>
