<h4>Home Surveillance Security System West Chester 19382</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more complaints, two weeks later on a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable added fees to complete the installation.</p>
