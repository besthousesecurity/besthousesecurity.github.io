<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
