<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

Unmonitored systems won't supply the exact same level of protection for your home, either.

High-security alarms might require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other ways that are deemed sufficiently secure for the function.</p>
