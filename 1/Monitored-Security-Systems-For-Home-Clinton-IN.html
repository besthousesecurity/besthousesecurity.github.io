<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable additional charges to complete the installation.</p>

Given that it is a PIR motion sensor, it just gets set off when it catches motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., animals and individuals. In addition, it doesn't get activated by small items. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has among the most advanced motion sensors that remove all incorrect alarms and only gets set off when individuals approach it.</p>
