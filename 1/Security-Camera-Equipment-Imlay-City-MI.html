<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

We think that's costly.</p>

<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and an unique appearance. This appearance is identifiable to almost everybody and hence functions as a deterrent to undesirable individuals. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and bad guys go in other places instead. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their apparent appearance.
