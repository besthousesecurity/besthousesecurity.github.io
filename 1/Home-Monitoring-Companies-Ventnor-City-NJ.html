<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
