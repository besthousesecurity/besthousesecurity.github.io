<p>Everything about Security provides expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days.
