The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If catching video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
