The city has actually considering that adopted a new partnership with General Electric in which street lights are equipped with cameras and microphones.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
