Now I pointed out this looked like a stretch thinking about previous Sims video games had intruders, but my friend mentioned the Sims 4 was produced a new generation, with a team of manufacturers surrounded by people OF that generation who would explain that the intrusion of their home or safe place could develop feelings of discomfort or possible even activating. Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing video games for a long period of time and a great deal of the stuff in earlier games I have actually played a years back would certainly NEVER EVER make the cut in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>
