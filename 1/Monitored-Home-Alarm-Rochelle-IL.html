Limit access to your property with hedges, fencing, and thorny shrubs. Also, it's simple to overshare on social networks, however it's wise not to relay any upcoming journeys or household vacations so bad people can find out when you're gone.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

We want we had actually understood about that additional charge upfront.</p>

<p>ADT is a household name, so we frequently check out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task.
