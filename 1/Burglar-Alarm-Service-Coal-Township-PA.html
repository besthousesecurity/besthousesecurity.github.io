<h4>Monitored Home Alarm Coal Township 17866</h4>
<p>Some wireless home systems are just for spotting burglars and set off a siren to frighten the intruders. Others notify security companies of a burglary or emergency. Dome Cameras - discrete and vandal-proof cameras with a larger viewing angle, best for inside or outside your home. Plus, the camera does not have infrared night vision.

<p>Frontpoint uses five packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy but ended up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance.
