In addition to having many cameras streaming high-definition video, the best DVR for CCTV setups will also offer large - and dependable - disk drives that can hold all of the recordings your cameras capture. Cellphone cameras, in the hands of a watchful public, are much more discriminating than CCTV cameras. When the general public takes photos and videos of suspicious activity, incidents can be acted upon much faster and at a lower cost than relying on publicly-funded legions of CCTVs mounted on walls and poles.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are placed in areas where they are thought to be most efficient, which normally includes highly populated towns, town hall, parking area, or numerous other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the placement of these cameras is very important, the criminal activity patterns in locations of interest are normally studied for periods of time to determine criminal activity hotspots where cameras could potentially be positioned. In various cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is utilized to precisely evaluate criminal activity patterns for camera positioning; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from police officers and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
<p>It is difficult to deny the huge advantage consumers gain by attaching their security cameras to the Internet, though as is frequently discussed by the media, there are hackers lurking everywhere.

The surveillance camera market has been plagued over the last few years by numerous hacks and exploits being found by security scientists and hackers alike. Very few security manufacturers have been spared the shame of finding out that their recorders and cameras have been hacked and managed by some unapproved person.</p>
