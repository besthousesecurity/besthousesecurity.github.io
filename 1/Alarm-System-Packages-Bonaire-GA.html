<p>Presently, Ring Alarm and the professional monitoring service are offered only within the U.S. (leaving out American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada (leaving out Quebec). IP cameras are much greater resolution, permitting audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses appointed to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more competence to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras.</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard disk drives or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are linked to has a difficult drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your handling taped video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use hard disks for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard disk malfunction.</p>

<h4>Wireless Security Alarm System Bonaire 31005</h4>

With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
