While some parts may be impacted for a little while by a power outage, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours till the electric service is restored. Landline systems use conventional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>

Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
