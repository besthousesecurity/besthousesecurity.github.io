<p>What many individuals do not realize is that there is another class of security camera that is straight available to the public, though not found in the huge box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these big box chains to secure their stock. Look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices stores and warehouse chains and you will discover in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the typical consumer camera.
