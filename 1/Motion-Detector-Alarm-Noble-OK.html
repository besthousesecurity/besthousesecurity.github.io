<p>All About Security provides expert, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis location. The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The first thing I look at in a security system are its system components. Home security industry is trying to offer new gadgets and technology is progressing.

But I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
