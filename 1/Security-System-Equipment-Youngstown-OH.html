<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself."

<p>Do not call 911 to cancel a false alarm. You need to call your alarm company. Some self monitored alarm systems are battery-powered whereas others are hardwired.
