<h4>Home Protection Security System Baker 70714</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be considerable additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
