As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
