<h3>CCTV Installation - How To Secure an IP Security Camera in Moultrie</h3>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

The system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
