<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who showed there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
