<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
