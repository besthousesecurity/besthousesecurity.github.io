I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
