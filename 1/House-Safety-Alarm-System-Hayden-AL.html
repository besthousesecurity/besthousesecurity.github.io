<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
