CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be minimized by changing a range of systems such as increasing the risk of an offender being collared, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
