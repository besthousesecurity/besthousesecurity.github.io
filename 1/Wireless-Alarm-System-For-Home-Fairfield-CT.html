<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications may appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions end up being apparent and unique.

Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or missing (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras outshine their cheaper cousins due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and record excellent low light video.</p>

So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, since apparently they auto restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too pricey, and not excellent.</p>
