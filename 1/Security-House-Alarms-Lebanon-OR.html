<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn indication monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company initially delved into home security in 2011, and its signature red lawn sign is nearly as common as ADT's classic blue.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that stores it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
