<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional problems, two weeks later on a new specialist was sent who showed there would be considerable added fees to complete the installation.</p>
