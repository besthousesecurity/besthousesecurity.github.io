<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
