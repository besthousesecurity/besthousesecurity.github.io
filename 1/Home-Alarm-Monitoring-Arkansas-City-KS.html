It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
<p>Frontpoint uses five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive strategy but wound up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.

It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
