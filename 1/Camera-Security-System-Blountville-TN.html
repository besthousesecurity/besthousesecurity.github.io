<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently gone through thorough background checks.
