<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
