I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
