The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night.
