<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
