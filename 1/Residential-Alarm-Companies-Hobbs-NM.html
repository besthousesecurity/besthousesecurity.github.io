<h4>DVR Security Camera System Hobbs 88240</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently undergone extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional problems, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who suggested there would be considerable service charges to finish the installation.</p>
