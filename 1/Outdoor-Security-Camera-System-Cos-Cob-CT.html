It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
