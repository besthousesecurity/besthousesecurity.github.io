<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently gone through thorough background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>

It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
