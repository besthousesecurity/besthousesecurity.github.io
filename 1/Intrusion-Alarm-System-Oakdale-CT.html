Because their style permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will supply more precise and less frequent alerts because many times the motion detection is triggered by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
