(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
