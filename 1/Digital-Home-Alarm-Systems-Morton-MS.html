<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>We have evaluated numerous crucial reasons one should think about commercial-grade cameras up until now, however, we have simply skimmed the surface of the subject. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is hardly ever a stand-alone system. It is worth understanding if your proposed camera system will integrate with other products.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the clever home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and clever thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic plan if you can't afford the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
