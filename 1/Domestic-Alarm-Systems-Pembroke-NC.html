<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks.
