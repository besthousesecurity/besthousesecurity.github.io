<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They typically have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, but they differ in resilience. Outdoor cameras should be weather condition resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most resilient. Since their style enables for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices. In terms of detection, it is much better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because typically times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less frequent signals.</p>
