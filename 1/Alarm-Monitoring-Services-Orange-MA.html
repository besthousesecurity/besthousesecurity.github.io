<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
