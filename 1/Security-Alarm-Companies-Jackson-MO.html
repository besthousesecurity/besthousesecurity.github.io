<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly setting off when movement was identified. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
