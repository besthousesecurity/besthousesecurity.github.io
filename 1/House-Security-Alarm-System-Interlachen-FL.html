<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and government centers, and residential clients. Honeywell's DIY security system depends on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like gadget with a camera on top. It functions as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and 3rd party-devices through Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. ADT provides monitored security packages that are customized to secure your home. Main features consist of the ability control your home security system from anywhere, established custom signals, supply live video monitoring (both outside and within), in addition to emergency alarms triggered by smoke, co2, or perhaps flooding.</p>
