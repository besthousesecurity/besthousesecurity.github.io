Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished.
