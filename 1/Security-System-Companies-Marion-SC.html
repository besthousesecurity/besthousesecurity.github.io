<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
