<h4>Best Surveillance Camera Brockton 02301</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently undergone thorough background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further complaints, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who showed there would be considerable added fees to finish the installation.</p>

A picture of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>
