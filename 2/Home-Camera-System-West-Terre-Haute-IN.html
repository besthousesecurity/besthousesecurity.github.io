As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
