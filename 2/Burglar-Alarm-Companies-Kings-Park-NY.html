Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>One example of SimpliSafe's high quality is their SmashSafe backup against tampering: If somebody attempts to disable your system, the monitoring service will inform police. Another example is the Heart beat feature, which constantly checks that the security system is working as meant. With over 3 years of experience, we've seen various technologies come and go.
