Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake.

In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently been subjected to thorough background checks.
