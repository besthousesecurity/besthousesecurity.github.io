The alarm is simply one of two we tested that includes an external siren, and we're satisfied that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property. We evaluated Somfy's more costly system, which included a wifi security camera, however more inexpensive kits are also available.
