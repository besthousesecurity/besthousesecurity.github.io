<p>On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other wise home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
