<p>I explained that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Cloud storage: Recorded video can be saved on the cloud in addition to on your video recorder.
