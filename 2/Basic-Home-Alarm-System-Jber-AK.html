Vivint Ping Camera provides you one-way video, two-way talk, and one-touch callout to help track guests, kids, senior parents, or pets when you're out.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
