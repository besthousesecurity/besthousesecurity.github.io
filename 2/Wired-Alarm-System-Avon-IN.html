<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
