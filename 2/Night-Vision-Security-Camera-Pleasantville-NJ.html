<h4>Best Security Alarm System For Home Pleasantville 08232</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more grievances, two weeks later a new professional was sent who indicated there would be significant additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
