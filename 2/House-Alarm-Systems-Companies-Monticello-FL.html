<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
