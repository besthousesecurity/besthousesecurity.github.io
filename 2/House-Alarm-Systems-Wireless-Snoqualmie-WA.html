<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hours a day. Offering consumers the alternative of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other devices a la carte, makes good sense for a number of reasons.

<p>Sensors are detectors built into the alarm system that send signals to the control board. Common home security sensors consist of those designed for walls, windows, garages, and doors.

<p>An on-site ringer will generally set off a bell or siren attached to the building when the alarm is tripped.

Automatic dialer alarms are not permitted to call 9-1-1.</p>
