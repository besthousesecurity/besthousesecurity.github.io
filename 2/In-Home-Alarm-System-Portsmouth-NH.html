<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
