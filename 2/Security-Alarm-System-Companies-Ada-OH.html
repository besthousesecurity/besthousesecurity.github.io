<h4>Wireless Alarm System Ada 45810</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently gone through extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further problems, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
