<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K footage considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. In cities with low break-in rates, security systems with less components and without professional monitoring are more viable alternatives. Those living in cities with higher crime rates may want to get the very best possible equipment and monitoring due to the higher chance of being robbed.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
