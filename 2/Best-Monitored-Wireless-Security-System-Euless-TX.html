<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
