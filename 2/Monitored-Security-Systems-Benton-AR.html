<h4>Security Cameras For Home Benton 72015</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further problems, two weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial service charges to finish the installation.</p>
