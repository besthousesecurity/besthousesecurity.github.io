<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
