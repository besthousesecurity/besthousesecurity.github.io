It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
