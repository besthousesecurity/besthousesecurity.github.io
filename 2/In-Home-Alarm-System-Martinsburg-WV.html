<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. And today's indoor security cameras provide a lot more than recorded video footage. Many include the option to view live action video, and cameras with two-way communication let you sign in with kids after school, inform Rover to leave your favorite chair, or frighten the daylights out of somebody who does not belong in your home (plus you'll have their picture, to boot!).</p>
<p>The clever bit is that the camera not only identifies that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, but it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too. Possibly more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically know.</p>
