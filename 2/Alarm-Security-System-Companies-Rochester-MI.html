<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
