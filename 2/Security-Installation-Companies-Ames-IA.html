Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks.
