<p>Brinks has pretty standard equipment, however we like its smart monitoring signals. Vivint has a track record for ingenious home security options, and the Ping Indoor Camera does not dissatisfy. Plus, SimpliSafe is adept on the equipment front. You can find everything from window sensors to leakage detectors to carbon monoxide gas sensors. Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, utilize a WiFi connection, are quick to establish, and can be positioned anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
