<h4>Residential Alarm Monitoring Vienna 31092</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further problems, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
