<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
