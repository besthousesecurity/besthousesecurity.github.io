<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
