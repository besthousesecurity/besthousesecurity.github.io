<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently undergone comprehensive background checks.
