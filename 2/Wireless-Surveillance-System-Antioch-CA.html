As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
