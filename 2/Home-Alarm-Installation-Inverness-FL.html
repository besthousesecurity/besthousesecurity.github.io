<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
