<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently undergone thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more complaints, two weeks later a new professional was sent who indicated there would be considerable added fees to complete the installation.</p>
