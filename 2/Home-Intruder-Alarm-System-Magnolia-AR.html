<h4>Alarm Security System For Home Magnolia 71753</h4>

With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
