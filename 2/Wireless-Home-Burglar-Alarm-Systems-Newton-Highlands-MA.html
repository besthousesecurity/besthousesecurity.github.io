<p>Most people lead hectic lives - from developing a business, running individual errands, earning money, to discovering time for the family. The pressure of maintaining a work-life balance often suggests that you're not on-site to manage your video surveillance systems and safeguard your business assets. It's wise to set up a remote management system when this is the case.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides extra information that may never ever have actually been possible previously, such as notice of an employee, by name and recognition number, getting in the building. A picture of that employee is presented on screen for verification (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating takes place.</p>
