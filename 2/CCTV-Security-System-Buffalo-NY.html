Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through thorough background checks.
