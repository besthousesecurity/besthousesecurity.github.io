<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
