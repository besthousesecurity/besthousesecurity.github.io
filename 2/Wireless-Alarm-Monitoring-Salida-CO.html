<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
