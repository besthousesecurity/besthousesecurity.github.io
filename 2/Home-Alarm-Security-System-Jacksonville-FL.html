<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. The loudest of the smart alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to represent animals, too. The alarm is simply one of 2 we tested that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from attempting to break in to your home. We tested Somfy's more pricey system, which included a wifi security camera, but more cost effective packages are also readily available.

When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
