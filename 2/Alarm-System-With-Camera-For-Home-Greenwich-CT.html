<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
