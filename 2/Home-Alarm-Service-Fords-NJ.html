Clear night vision is one of the most crucial functions for outdoor security cameras. To get the very best and brightest night view, consider a camera with infrared (IR) innovation to sending bright light through wavelengths.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
