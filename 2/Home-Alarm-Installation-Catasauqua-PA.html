<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
