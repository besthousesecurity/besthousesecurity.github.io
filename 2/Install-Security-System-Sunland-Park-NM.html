<p>Arlo Pro 2 likewise has an excellent Night Vision feature. It is geared up with infrared lenses that allow the camera to record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of exposure at night. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your mobile phone app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded video footage will be black and white and a little dark so you may not be able to see information clearly.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
