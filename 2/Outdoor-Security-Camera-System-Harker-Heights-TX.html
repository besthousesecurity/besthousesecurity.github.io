With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
