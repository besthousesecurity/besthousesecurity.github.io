<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
