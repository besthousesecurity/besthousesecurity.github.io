<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home gadgets like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks. If you already have a security gadget from another brand name, like a Blink XT camera, it most likely won't deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>However, thus numerous other comparable alarm systems, Scout Alarm does not included a security camera.

<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. Alexa support is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera effectively deals with all the usual functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little more if you want to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
