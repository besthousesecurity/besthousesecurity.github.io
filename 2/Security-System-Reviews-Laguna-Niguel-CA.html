A basic system will normally only include the control panel, sensors, and an audible alarm. If you want any other features, you will either need to buy an advanced plan or add-on to your basic system, which, depending on the brand, might get expensive.</p>
<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see listed below) technically has all the same smarts and more comprehensive 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still excellent, and it's a little better worth - though its cost is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the cash is all the usual Arlo characteristics in regards to the solid build quality, superb camera video, tons of creative features and a polished app.</p>
<p>For some, that may be worth the $300 price tag. But while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Camera IQ, a lot of the cameras we took a look at deal the same perks at a more reasonable price.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
