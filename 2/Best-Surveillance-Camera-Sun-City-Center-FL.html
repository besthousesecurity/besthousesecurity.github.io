<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
