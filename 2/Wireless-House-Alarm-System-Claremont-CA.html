We value that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
