<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
