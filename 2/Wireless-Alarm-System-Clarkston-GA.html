<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
