<h3>Choosing the Best Security System For Your Home in Germantown</h3>
<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually observed some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this evaluation and test, as needed.</p>
<p>There are several options for night vision cameras available. Most of them are cost-effective yet extremely practical. Go for designs that leverage infrared (IR) innovation if you're looking for night vision cameras that offer the brightest and best night view.

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and clever thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic package if you can't afford the extra equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
