Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
