<p>If you have the Arlo plugged in through its magnetic cable, you can configure detection hot zones, outside of which it'll neglect motion - helpful if you live near a busy roadway, for instance, but the power requirement rather nullifies its otherwise wireless nature.

Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
