In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was captured using cops databases to collect info on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate numbers of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he tried to blackmail customers who were wed. Picture what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Some house owners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll discourage potential burglars. These indications might be affixed to a front door, a prominent window, published in the front lawn, or at the top of a driveway. The concept of publishing a security alarm system sign is that prospective scoundrels may not want to take a gamble about whether the sign suggests the presence of a home security system.</p>
<p>Vivint's monitoring charges are in line with our other top security companies, which is impressive given the innovative proprietary equipment and services that include a Vivint home security system. We also like that Vivint provides you the option to buy your equipment outright, which suggests you're off the hook for a long-lasting contract-- however that does require a large up-front payment.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm offers on the cheap; it's also expert monitoring. Normally, we 'd expect to pay anywhere from $15 to $60+ per month for expert monitoring. Ring Alarm gives it to you for a cool $10 per month. That's quite actually the lowest rate we've ever seen. Today, wireless cameras are a vital part of any security system.</p>
