<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and features a practical mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the price, and best of all, it comes with free cloud storage (approximately 2 hours in overall). Since Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app also has a connection to Ring's Next-door neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other occurrences in your area, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is fairly robust, and while it does not have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has lots of features for the rate.</p>

You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>
