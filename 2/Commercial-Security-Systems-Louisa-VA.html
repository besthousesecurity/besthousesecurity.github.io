<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A few other companies (like Nest, residence, and ring) have no-contract systems. But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system. NOTE: We added in the cost of the SimpliCam, although there's a special today that offers you one free of charge. That brings the first-year overall down to $553.88. Be sure to try to find offers like this, as SimpliSafe uses a totally free camera quite frequently.</p>

<p>Installing your own home security tech - wireless security cameras, IP cameras, motion detectors - is more straightforward than ever. You no longer require reams of cable television, a bank of screens, or a substantial disk drive to save all the video, since whatever can be established in minutes and managed from your phone. We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, but the white and black variation can in fact be clearer and give you higher-quality video. This isn't really a big offer thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- but for the record, stick with black and white.</p>
<p>The only real issue we have is with the cost. The package isn't at all cheap in the first location, but if you want to store 4K recordings in the cloud you'll need a higher-tier extra subscription. However, it's difficult to argue that the Arlo Ultra does not make its cost - it's simply that it's quite a niche item due to the fact that of that cost, when the Arlo Pro 3 has the exact same smarts for less.</p>
