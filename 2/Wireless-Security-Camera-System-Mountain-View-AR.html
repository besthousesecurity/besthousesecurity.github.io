<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
