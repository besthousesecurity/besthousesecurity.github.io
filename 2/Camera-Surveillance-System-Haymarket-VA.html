<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control board (normally located in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been activated, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours). However, smart alarms do need a center that enables the different components to wirelessly link. But for a lot of clever alarms this center can be positioned throughout your home.</p>
