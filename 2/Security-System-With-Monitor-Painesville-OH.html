<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that people have actually entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too. Possibly more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it need to immediately know.</p>
