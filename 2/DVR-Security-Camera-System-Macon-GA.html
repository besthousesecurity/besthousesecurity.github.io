<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
