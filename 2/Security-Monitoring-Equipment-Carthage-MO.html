<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to up to 20 family members. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature offered from all companies. If this is a high priority, make certain to investigate the company's features or talk with a representative directly.

Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automated door lock and wise thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the additional equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
