<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Remote Areas - If a location around your business is secluded, chances are unpleasant characters are going to pick up on that, making these spots popular for planning and bring out theft. One common area is near a dumpster-an employee may get rid of the taken items just to recover them later or send out an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can hinder this activity.</p>
<p>An on-site ringer will typically trigger a bell or siren connected to the building when the alarm is tripped. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a phone call is instantly put to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is responded to. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to call 9-1-1.</p>
