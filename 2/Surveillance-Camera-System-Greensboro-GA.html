<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
