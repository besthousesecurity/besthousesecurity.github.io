<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the clever alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's an issue. Throughout testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be gotten used to represent animals, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're pleased that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your property.
