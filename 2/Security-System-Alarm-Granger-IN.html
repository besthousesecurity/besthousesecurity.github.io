<p>Everything about Security offers professional, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and businesses throughout the higher Indianapolis location. The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
