<p>A social agreement about how cameras must be utilized is very important, however in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides some protection versus video searches carried out by the authorities, there are presently no basic, legally enforceable guidelines to restrict privacy invasions and protect versus abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and the length of time are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government companies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and implemented; and what penalties would apply to violators.</p>
