<h4>Wireless Security Home System Graham 76450</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently undergone extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more problems, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable added fees to finish the installation.</p>
