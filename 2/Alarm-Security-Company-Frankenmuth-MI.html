<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise.
