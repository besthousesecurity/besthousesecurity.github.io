<p>All About Security provides expert, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis area. The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
