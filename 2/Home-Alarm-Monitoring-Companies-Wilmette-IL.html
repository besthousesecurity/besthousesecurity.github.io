<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. A wireless system will typically include a mobile app that makes them much easier for you to control and monitor. Door sensing units are an important element of burglar alarm systems as they will notify you in case a door opens suddenly. Regular wireless security systems may not be the best option as they're restricted in distance if you have an expansive home.</p>
<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. A number of cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
