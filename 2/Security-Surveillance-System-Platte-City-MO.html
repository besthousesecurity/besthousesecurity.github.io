No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
