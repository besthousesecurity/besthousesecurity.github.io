<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently undergone extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more problems, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
