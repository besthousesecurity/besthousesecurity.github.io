<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even activate incorrect alarms.

Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
