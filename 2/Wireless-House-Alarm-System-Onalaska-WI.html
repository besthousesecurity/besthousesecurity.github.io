<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements may be impacted briefly by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours until the electrical service is restored. Landline systems utilize traditional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>

Vivint's other devices such as sensors and outdoor and doorbell cameras are suitable and equally high-end with 3rd party clever home devices. The system uses a cellular connection, which safeguards versus burglar wire cutting, but may be a problem in rural areas where the cellular signal is weak.</p>
