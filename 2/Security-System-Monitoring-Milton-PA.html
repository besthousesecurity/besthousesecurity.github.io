<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If catching video in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Support 5 kinds of Video input consisting of HDTVI, AHD, HDCVI, Analog and IP. While this camera records video without concerns, there's a noticeable lag when you stream live video. Regrettably, the user manual is tough to follow, and mounting the Amcrest 4MP UltraHD on the wall restricts the camera's rotation options. This system introduces ADT into the 2020s with clever cameras, optional self-monitoring, a free mobile app, and reasonable prices. Our only genuine problems are large equipment and a glitchy app.</p>
