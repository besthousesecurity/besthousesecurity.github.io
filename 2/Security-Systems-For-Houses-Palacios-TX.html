A lot of home security professionals will tell you that video surveillance is essential for keeping a property safe. Premium, tactically placed residential security cameras permit homeowners to keep watch over their homes at all times. They will also work as a visible deterrent that makes burglars, intruders and vandals think twice about attempting to go into or ruin a home or residential or commercial property. What's more, tape-recorded surveillance camera feeds offer visual evidence that can help police identify and nab criminals of property criminal offenses.</p>
<p>Specialists studying how the camera systems in Britain are operated have actually also discovered that the mainly male (and probably tired) operators often utilize the cameras to voyeuristically spy on ladies. Completely one in 10 females were targeted for completely voyeuristic reasons, the researchers found. Numerous incidents have been reported in the United States. In one, New york city City authorities in a helicopter apparently monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple taking pleasure in the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop terrace.</p>

To see that video, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer system.</p>
