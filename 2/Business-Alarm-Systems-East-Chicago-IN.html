<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently undergone extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more problems, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial service charges to finish the installation.</p>
