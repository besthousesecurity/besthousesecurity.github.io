<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
