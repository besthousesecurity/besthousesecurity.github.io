<p>Besides resolution, likewise think about the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are produced equivalent. Depending upon the lens' field of vision, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge range in terms of the camera's vision cone.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
