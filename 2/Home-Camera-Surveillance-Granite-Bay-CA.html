Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error.

The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished.
