<h4>Home Alarm Installation Marion 42064</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
