<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
