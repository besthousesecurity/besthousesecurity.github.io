<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
