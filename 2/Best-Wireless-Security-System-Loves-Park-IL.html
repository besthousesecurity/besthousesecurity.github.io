<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
