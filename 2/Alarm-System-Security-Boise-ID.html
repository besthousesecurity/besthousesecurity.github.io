<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
