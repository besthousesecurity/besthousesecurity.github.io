Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error.

In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently undergone extensive background checks.
