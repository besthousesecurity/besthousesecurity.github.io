<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements may be affected momentarily by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for numerous hours until the electric service is restored. Landline systems utilize traditional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>

Our technicians have years of experience in offering end-to-end services for your security application, from site study and requirements assessment, to support and maintenance after installation.

Although some companies offer totally free or heavily affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile.
