<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
