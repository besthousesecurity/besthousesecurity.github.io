<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently gone through thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional problems, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
