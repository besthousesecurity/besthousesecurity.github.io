<h4>Security Camera Installation Sheffield 35660</h4>

Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently undergone extensive background checks.
