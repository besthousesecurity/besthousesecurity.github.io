<h4>House Alarm Monitoring Bath 18014</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who suggested there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
