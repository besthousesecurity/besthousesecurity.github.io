The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
