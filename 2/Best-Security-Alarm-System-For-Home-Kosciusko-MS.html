Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

Dome Cameras - discrete and vandal-proof cameras with a broader viewing angle, ideal for inside or outside your home. Plus, the camera does not have infrared night vision. It counts on the light to turn on and show you what exists, but we 'd at least like some infrared backup.</p>

Residence's basic packages are the Entrance package and the Iota package.
