It will not deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

<h4>Alarm Camera Security System Freeport 32439</h4>
<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some people. Abode has actually upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a better variety for sensors. Both the initial Residence system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we evaluated that also works with HomeKit. We have actually encountered a couple of technical problems while long-lasting testing the Home Iota, therefore will continue to evaluate and update accordingly. We no longer advise it.</p>
<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high rate: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the initial charge. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for individual detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
