The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
