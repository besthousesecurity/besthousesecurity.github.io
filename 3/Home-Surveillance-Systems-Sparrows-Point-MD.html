Home has actually updated that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better variety for sensing units. Both the original Home system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we tested that likewise works with HomeKit. We have actually encountered a few technical concerns while long-term screening the Residence Iota, therefore will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a bit more if you wish to add additional functions, like a security camera.
