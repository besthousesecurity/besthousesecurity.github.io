Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently gone through thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant service charges to complete the installation.</p>
