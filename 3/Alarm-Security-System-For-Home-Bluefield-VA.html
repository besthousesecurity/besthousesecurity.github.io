Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
