<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>The very first (and most obvious, for sure) part of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are right for your system depends on your private needs and budget; are you putting them inside or outdoors? Is 1080P a big sufficient resolution? Will they be able to tape and see video effectively in low-lighting? Are they put with appropriate field of vision, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are all important questions to be considered when picking security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>

<p>At $24.99 each month, SimpliSafe's top-tier bundle is still very affordable compared to the other companies on this list. It's virtually a take.
