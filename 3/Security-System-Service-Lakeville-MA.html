<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. A few years back, there were just a handful of security companies in the game. Now, there are lots. House owners picking a system should look for a trustworthy, reputable company.

<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter kit". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have actually extended customizability or a vast array of features.
