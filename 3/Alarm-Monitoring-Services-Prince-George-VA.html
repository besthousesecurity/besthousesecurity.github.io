<h4>Best Home Wireless Alarm System Prince George 23875</h4>
<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hr a day. Giving consumers the alternative of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte, makes good sense for a couple of factors. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure. Your monitoring company will get the alert and then alert the authorities for you when something triggers your alarm. Appears like a more secure bet to us.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a bit more if you want to add extra functions, like a security camera. While a common agreement runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>Pricing - Vivint isn't one of the most affordable cost alternatives. A total selection of equipment will cost around $2,000, and there's no money-back assurance after 3 days. You can spread out the cost of the upfront investment over a chosen period of time, but if you do so, you'll need to sign-up to a service strategy rather than pay-as-you-go (a 100% early cancellation cost would apply to that contract). Service agreements range from $39.99-$ 49.99 each month.</p>
