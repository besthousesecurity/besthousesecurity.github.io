<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
