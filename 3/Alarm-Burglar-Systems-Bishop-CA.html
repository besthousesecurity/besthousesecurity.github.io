<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
