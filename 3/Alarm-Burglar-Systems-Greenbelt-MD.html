<h4>Cheap Surveillance Cameras Greenbelt 20770</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later a new technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
