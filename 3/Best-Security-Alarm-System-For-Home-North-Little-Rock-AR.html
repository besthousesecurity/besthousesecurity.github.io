The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (normally located in the entryway hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have been triggered, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours).
