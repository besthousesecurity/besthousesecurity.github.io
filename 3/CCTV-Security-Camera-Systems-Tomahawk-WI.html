<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
