<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
