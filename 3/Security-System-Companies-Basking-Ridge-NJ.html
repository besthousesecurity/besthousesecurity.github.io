<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
