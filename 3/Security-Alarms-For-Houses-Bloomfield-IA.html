<h2>Home Security System Review in Bloomfield Iowa</h2>
<p>Years back, all alarm systems required you to have a landline phone and that landline was utilized to connect your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other options.

We enjoy that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, however the white and black version can actually be clearer and provide you higher-quality video. This isn't really a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to white and black.</p>
