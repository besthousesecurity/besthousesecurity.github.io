<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? Having a hardwired security system installed might be a simpler and more inexpensive option if so. However if your home currently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one eliminates the requirement for drilling into your walls and also gives you the option of a Do It Yourself install. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for a simpler, more structured installation, hardwired systems are more trustworthy because they aren't based on disturbance.</p>
<p>The security systems I have actually created and carried out are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist danger or neighborhood burglars or vandals. The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and home and not to see individuals as they jaywalk across the street or run a red light (which both are, by the way, against the law). Those are different options with different requirements and objectives.</p>

<p>Where Nest is a little much better than Ring is that the Nest cameras integrate well with the system. Nest sells several indoor and outdoor cameras in addition to a video doorbell.

If you have small children, window sensing units are small enough to contribute to medicine cabinets, kitchen area cabinets, swimming pool gates, safes, and any other risk zones.</p>
