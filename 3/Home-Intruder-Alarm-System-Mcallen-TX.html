<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further problems, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be significant service charges to finish the installation.</p>

The Arlo Ultra does not included a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you want to save any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year. But if you want the outright best when it pertains to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
