<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anyone in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem. During screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.
