<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anyone in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem. During screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property. We evaluated Somfy's more pricey system, which featured a wifi security camera, however more budget-friendly kits are also readily available. Regardless of the large price here, there's no external monitoring option.</p>

Our favorite standout is the 4K image sensor, which lets you zoom in on video and images and still keep small details clear (like license plate numbers). 4G LTE security camera, likewise called cellular camera, works on 4G data with an integrated SIM card instead of the router network to work.</p>
