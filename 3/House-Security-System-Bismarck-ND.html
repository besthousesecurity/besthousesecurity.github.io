<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new technician was sent who suggested there would be substantial service charges to finish the installation.</p>
