No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening.
