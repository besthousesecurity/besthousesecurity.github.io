<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
