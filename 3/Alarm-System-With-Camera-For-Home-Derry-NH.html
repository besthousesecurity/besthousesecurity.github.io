But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system.

Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
