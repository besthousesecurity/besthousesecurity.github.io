The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
