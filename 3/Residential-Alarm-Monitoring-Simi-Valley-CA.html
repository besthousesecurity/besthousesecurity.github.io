<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough.

The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

For a fee, you can include vehicle, individual, and animal detection and more cloud-based video storage.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.
