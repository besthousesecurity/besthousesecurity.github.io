<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
