<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>Restricted access to remote monitoring. Most wired security systems have professional monitoring but do not have access to remote monitoring. Because the system is more like a landline than a cellular phone, the system is unable to connect to an app on your mobile phone.
