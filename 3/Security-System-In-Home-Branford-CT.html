<h3>Wireless Security Camera Systems in Branford CT 06405</h3>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
