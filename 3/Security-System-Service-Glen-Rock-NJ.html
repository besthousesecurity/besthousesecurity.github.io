<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
