<p>You use a keypad to by hand equip and disarm your home security system. Like the majority of wireless security equipment, keypads can be set up anywhere you want. The majority of wireless keypads are put by the front door, however it doesn't need to be. You might want several keypads if your home has several entrances that are typically utilized, such as one by the front door and one in the garage, or if your home is several stories. The keypad permits you to enter your security code in case the alarm is set off while you are at home. Select an available placement that works for you.</p>
