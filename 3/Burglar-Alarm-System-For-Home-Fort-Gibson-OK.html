<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
