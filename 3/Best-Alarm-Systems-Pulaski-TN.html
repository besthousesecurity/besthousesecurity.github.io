<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
