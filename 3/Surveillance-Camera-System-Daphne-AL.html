<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>The smart bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will likewise have a stab at identifying them too. Perhaps more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it need to automatically understand.</p>
