<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
