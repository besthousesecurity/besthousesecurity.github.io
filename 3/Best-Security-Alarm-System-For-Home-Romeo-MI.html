<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan but wound up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm alert while on getaway, she had no other way of assessing whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her cat had actually managed to trip the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
