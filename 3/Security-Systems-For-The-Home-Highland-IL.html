<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. And today's indoor security cameras provide a lot more than recorded video footage. Many feature the option to view live action video, and cameras with two-way communication let you check in with kids after school, inform Rover to get off your preferred chair, or scare the daytimes out of someone who does not belong in your home (plus you'll have their photo, to boot!).</p>
<p>Professionals studying how the camera systems in Britain are run have also discovered that the mostly male (and most likely bored) operators regularly utilize the cameras to voyeuristically spy on women.

In one, New York City cops in a helicopter allegedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared camera on an amorous couple delighting in the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop terrace.</p>

<h3>Easy Remote Viewing of a Home Security Video Surveillance Alarm in Highland</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary worth. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>You don't need to faff around linking a center to your router - everything simply works out of package, and through the polished and user-friendly app you can check in on a live feed and review recordings made when motion was identified. You can keep these recordings for 2 days, for complimentary. House owners are installing DIY wireless home security systems at a record speed. The missing out on link, however, is the capability to in fact see what's going on in your home. That's where a wireless Wi-Fi camera enters play.</p>
