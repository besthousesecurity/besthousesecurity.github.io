<h4>Security System Equipment Waynesville 45068</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently undergone thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more complaints, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
