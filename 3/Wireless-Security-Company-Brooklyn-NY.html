<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up because as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to purchase an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>

<p>These kinds of cameras permit discreet positioning which suggests you can capture good footage of theft and criminal damage.
