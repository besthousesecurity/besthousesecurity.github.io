The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
