<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
