I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
