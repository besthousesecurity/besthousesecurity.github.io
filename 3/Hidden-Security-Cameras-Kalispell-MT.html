No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
