<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
