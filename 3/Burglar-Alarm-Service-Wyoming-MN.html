<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
