<h2>Local Home Security Companies in Yucaipa California</h2>

Stick it up anywhere you like outside, and it'll track motion, temperature level and ambient light conditions. You can utilize that info to trigger your Shade lights, and likewise to activate any Apple HomeKit gizmos under your roofing.</p>
