<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level.
