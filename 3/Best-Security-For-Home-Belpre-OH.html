<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.

I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print.
