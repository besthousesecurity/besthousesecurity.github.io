<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
