<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
