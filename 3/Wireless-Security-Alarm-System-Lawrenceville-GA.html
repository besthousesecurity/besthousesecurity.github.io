Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they retained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and imposed; and what penalties would apply to lawbreakers.</p>
