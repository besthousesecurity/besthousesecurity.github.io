In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is rarely a stand-alone system. It is worth understanding if your proposed camera system will integrate with other products.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
