<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
