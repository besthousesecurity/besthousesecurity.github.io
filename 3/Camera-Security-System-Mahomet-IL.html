<p>All About Security offers expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and businesses throughout the greater Indianapolis location. The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
