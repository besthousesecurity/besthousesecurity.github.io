Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more complaints, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who indicated there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
