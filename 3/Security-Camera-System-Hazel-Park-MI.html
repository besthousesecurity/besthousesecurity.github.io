No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
