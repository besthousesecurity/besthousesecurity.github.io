When activated, your system can be set up to manage lights, door locks, thermostats, cameras and more. Base stations are most common with 100% wire-free outdoor (or indoor) cameras.

<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it might be a crime, yet the same individual could place a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
