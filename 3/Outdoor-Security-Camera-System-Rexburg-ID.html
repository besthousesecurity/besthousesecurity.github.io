This is also called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
