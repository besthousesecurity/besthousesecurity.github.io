<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
