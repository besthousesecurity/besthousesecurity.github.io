<p>Other functions that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known rival-- the Ring Floodlight Cam-- consist of pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to intuitively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's in fact optional: You can look back just 2 hours and you're limited to 3 downloads monthly if you do not subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
