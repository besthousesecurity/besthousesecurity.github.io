<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hours a day. Giving consumers the alternative of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other gadgets a la carte, makes sense for a couple of factors. While professional monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and after that inform the authorities for you. Looks like a more secure bet to us.</p>
<p>The majority of monitoring companies will first connect to you so that they can understand if the alarm was real or if it was a mishap. If you do not respond or you say that it wasn't a mishap, the alarm monitoring company will notify the authorities right away. Different parts of your system will activate various parts of the alarm, which tells the monitoring company what you require - firemens, cops, or paramedics.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the clever home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't pay for the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic plan. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
