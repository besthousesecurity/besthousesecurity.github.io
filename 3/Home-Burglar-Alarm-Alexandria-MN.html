The lower the frame rate, the less frequently a still is taken; this leads to choppier video footage. You'll wish to think about the frame rate of the camera you acquire prior to choosing.

In fact, we don't suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to distinguish between a cars and truck and a person, for instance, enables you to minimize unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin.</p>
