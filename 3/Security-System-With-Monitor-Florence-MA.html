When activated, your system can be set up to control lights, door locks, thermostats, cameras and more. Base stations are most common with 100% wire-free outdoor (or indoor) cameras.

<p>During the night, though it lacks the complete IR LED selection of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
<p>This also depends on the provider, but you can expect signing an agreement with service providers who need expert installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some contracts might span as much as 60 months or 5 years. We would suggest thinking about a DIY home security system instead if you desire to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
