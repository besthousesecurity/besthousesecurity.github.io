These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space.

<h3>Hidden Security Cameras Vs Overt Surveillance Cameras in Mystic</h3>
