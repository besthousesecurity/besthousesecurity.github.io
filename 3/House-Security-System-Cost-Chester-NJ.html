<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Benefits: low rate of incorrect alarms, extremely reliable sensing units, and high rate of detection.
