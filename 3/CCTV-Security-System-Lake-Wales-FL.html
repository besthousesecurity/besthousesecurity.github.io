As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
