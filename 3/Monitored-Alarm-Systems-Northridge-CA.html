<h4>Wireless Surveillance System Northridge 91325</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently undergone thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
