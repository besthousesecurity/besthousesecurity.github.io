<p>Burglar alarms have ended up being basic equipment in stores and other organisations, and they're becoming progressively typical in private homes also.

These cameras typically feature two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensing unit. Similar to any security camera, check out the video resolution and field of vision.
