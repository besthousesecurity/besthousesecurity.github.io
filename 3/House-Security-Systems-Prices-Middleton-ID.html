<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
