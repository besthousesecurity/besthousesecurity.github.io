Whether you supervise simply one residential or commercial property or lots of remote developments-that means no more worries for you about scheduling, logistics, or unanticipated absences.

<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface offers extra details that may never ever have been possible before, such as notice of a staff member, by name and identification number, going into the building. A picture of that staff member is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating happens.</p>
