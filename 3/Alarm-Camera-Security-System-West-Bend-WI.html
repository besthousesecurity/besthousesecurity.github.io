I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
