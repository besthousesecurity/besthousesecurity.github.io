<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
