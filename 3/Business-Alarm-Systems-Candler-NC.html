<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall.
