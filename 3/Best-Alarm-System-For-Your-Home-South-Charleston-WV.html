<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

<h4>House Alarm Companies South Charleston 25309</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently undergone extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further complaints, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
