<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
