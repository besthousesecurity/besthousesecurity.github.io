<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently undergone extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional grievances, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who showed there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
