<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of up to one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have seen some improvements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this review and evaluate, as needed.</p>
