<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we liked it as a pet cam ). It has since been enhanced and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration alternatives.
