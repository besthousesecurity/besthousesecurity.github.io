No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
