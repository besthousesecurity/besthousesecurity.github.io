Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

A picture of that staff member exists on screen for verification (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating takes place.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
