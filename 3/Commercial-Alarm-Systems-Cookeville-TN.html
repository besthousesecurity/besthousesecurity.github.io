<h3>Opposing Arguments to the Use of CCTV Security Camera Surveillance in Cookeville TN 38501</h3>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
