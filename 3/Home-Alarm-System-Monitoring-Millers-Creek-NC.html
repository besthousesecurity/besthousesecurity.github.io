We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with person detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
