<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some parts may be impacted temporarily by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electrical service is brought back.
