<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
