<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to finish the installation.</p>
