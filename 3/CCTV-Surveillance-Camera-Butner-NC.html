<h4>Business Security Systems Butner 27509</h4>
<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between finding and tape-recording movement. Since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact turn on when it discovers motion. If a wicked wrongdoer was quickly enough, they might get past the camera before it had time to record them.</p>
<p>Security: There have been lots of headlines about hackers jeopardizing home cameras, child displays, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so make sure to inspect what actions has each maker taken to remove this problem. Search for a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make certain it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>
