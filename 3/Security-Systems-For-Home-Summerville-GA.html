<h4>Surveillance Cameras For Home Summerville 30747</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager reached 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more problems, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
