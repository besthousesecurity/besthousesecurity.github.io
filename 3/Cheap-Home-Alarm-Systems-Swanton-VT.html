<h4>Burglar Alarms For Homes Swanton 05488</h4>
<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some individuals. House has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a better variety for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we checked that also works with HomeKit.
