<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, supplying trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years back, we developed security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're transforming the clever home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Since they're so clearly recognizable as a security camera, they're a fantastic deterrent also, and they're easy to mount just about anywhere.

We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, but the black and white version can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality video. This isn't actually a big offer thinking about the Argus 2's cost and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick to black and white.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of everything, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automatic door lock and clever thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic plan if you can't pay for the extra equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
