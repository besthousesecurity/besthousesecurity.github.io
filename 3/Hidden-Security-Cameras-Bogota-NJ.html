<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
