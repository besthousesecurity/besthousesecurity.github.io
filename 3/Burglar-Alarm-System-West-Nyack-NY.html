<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras lower criminal offense. There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the device to act as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
