<p>Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>

<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer free" alarm are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is spent for within the first year, but do they decrease your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 regular monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years. That forces you to greatly overpay. Besides paying too much, what if their service is bad? Regrettable, you're trapped in their contract.</p>
