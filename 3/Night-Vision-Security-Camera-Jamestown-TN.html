<p>A main station alarm connects the protected residential or commercial property to a remote location through telephone circuits, or other ways where an operator receives it, and calls the appropriate cops or fire agency.

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to up to 20 member of the family. However, shared monitoring isn't a function available from all companies. Be sure to investigate the company's features or speak with a representative straight if this is a high priority. Reacting to false alarms can needlessly cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - cash each year. In addition, officers responding to these incorrect alarms are unable to respond to actual emergency situations or conduct preventative patrols.</p>
