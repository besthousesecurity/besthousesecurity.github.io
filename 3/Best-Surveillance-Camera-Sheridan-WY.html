The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
