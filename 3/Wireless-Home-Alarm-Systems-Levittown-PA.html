<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
