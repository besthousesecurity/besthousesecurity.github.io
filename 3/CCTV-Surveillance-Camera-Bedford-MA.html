<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
