<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements might be impacted briefly by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electric service is brought back.
