<p>The security systems I have actually designed and executed are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist risk or community thieves or vandals. The systems are released for the protection of lives and residential or commercial property and not to enjoy individuals as they jaywalk across the street or run a traffic signal (which both are, by the method, versus the law).

On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that plainly stands out to alert thieves that your home is under surveillance.</p>
