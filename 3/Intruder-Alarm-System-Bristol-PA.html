<h4>Door Security System Bristol 19007</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional grievances, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
