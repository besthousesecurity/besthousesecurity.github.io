<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. Nearly 100 surveillance cameras-- 24 PTZ cameras, 17 dome cameras, and 54 license acknowledgment cameras are being installed on 64 power poles in Birmingham, Alabama. The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County City Area Crime Center The license plate recognition camera data will be uploaded to the FBI's Wrongdoer Justice Information Services, and the city will get the content from the FBI's portal. Although a proposed ordinance requiring all establishments with alcohol licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was abandoned in the face of opposition, numerous bars implicated of breaching liquor laws have entered permission decrees with the city's Liquor Control board, needing them to do just that.</p>

While they might terrify a burglar away, the downside is that no one will be contacted us to come to your home, and you will have to call emergency situation services yourself.
