<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more problems, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
