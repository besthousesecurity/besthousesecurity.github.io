<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
