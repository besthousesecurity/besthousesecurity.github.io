<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
