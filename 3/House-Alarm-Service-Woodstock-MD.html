<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>Any balances owed the city for incorrect alarm fees must be paid by mail within 20 days following service.
