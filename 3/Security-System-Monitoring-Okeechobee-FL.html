Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further problems, two weeks later on a new specialist was sent who showed there would be substantial service charges to complete the installation.</p>
