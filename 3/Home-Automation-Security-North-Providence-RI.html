I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
