<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential transgressors are less most likely to devote criminal activity if they believe they are being enjoyed or have a greater threat of being captured. This is also referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that chances to offend can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the offender needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its desired impact.</p>
