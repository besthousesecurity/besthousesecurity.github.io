<h3>Hidden Cameras - The CBI Surveillance For Your Residence in Gibsonia PA 15044</h3>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic.
